# Game-Labs
A repository created to collect all the game based projects made by me. As this can help me strength my skills like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc. As well as provide a common platform for others to access my projects. Your suggestions for existing games or new games are humbly welcomed!

# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game which has a quite simple logic and thus not so difficult to code. However it acts as a great start to check your implementation skills of topics like DOM Manipulation in JavaScript as well as working with arrays. A game you can play with your frnd when bored (hope u have one unlike me!)

# Rock-Paper-Scissor 
A game which has a quite simple logic and thus not so difficult to code. However it acts as a great start to check your implementation skills of topics like if-else statements, math functions, etc. A game you can with a bot, no needs of frnds!!
